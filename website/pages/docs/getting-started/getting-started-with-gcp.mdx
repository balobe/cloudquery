# Getting Started with GCP

<DownloadSection />

## Running

### Generate command

After installing CloudQuery, you need to generate a `cloudquery.yml` file that will describe which cloud provider you want to use and which resources you want CloudQuery to ETL:

```bash
cloudquery destination postgresql
cloudquery gen source gcp
```

All official and approved community plugins are listed [here](/plugins) with their respective documentation.

<SpawnSection />

### Authenticate with GCP

CloudQuery needs to be authenticated with your GCP account in order to `sync` information from your cloud setup to your
chosen destination/database.

<ReadonlyTip />

You need to set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable - see [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started#command-line) for more details on where to get it.

<Tabs options={[ 'Linux and OSX', 'Windows (CMD)', 'Windows (PowerShell)' ]}>

<Tab>

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS={Path to your google credentials}
```

</Tab>

<Tab>

```bash
SET GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS={Path to your google credentials}
```

</Tab>

<Tab>

```powershell
$Env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS={Path to your google credentials}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Sync Command

Once source and destination plugin configuration are generated and you are authenticated with Azure,
run the following command to sync the resources.

```bash
cloudquery sync
```

### Exploring and Running Queries

<ExploreSection/>

Schema and tables for GCP are available [here](/plugins/gcp/tables).

Here is an example query for GCP:

#### Find all buckets Without uniform bucket level access

```sql
SELECT project_id, name, self_link AS link
FROM gcp_storage_buckets
WHERE iam_configuration_uniform_bucket_level_access_enabled = FALSE;
```

### Cloudquery Policies

CloudQuery Policies allow users to write security, governance, cost, and compliance rules with SQL, and run them with `psql`.
You can read more about policies [here](/docs/policies).

## Next Steps

[Visit the GCP plugin documentation](/plugins/gcp) to read more about it, explore the supported tables and learn about advanced configurations.
